## 💡 Introduction

Build Bot was created to speed up the map-development process in Constellation. It uses the well-known pyautogui Python module to 'print' an image of your choice onto the map builder.

## ❗ Failsafe (important)

- If you want to stop printing as the application is running, move your cursor to a corner of your screen to activate the fail safe.   


## 🔫 Tips & Troubleshooting

- Select an image that has clean smooth lines for a nice looking output. 

- Picture not printing clearly? Try running your image through a stencil maker first to produce an image with clean smooth lines. I use <a href="https://online.rapidresizer.com/photograph-to-pattern.php" target="_blank">this</a> one. 

- If the image is not printing in the position you want, try adjusting the y and x offset
